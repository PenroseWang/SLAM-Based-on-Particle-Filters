# ECE 276A Project #2 - SLAM

Implement simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using odometry, inertial, 2-D laser range, and RGBD measurements from a differential-drive robot. Use the IMU, odometry, and laser measurements to localize the robot and build a 2-D occupancy grid map of the environment. Use the RGBD information to color the floor of the 2-D map.

IMU, odometry, and laser measurements are included in the project. RGBD information can be found at: httpâ€¦.
